                <p>
                    Birthday : January 27, 2002<br>
                    Student Number : 301183378<br>
                    Program : Software Engineering Technology<br>
                    <br>
                    I have learned and applied effective communication methods, work methods, and work processes in practice through a personal project with students working in a co-up. Because the project is creating a website, I can use JS/CSS/HTML and the framework accordingly. 

                    I did not learn them in school, but I learned them on my own, and I'm experiencing how to apply them. I am familiar with agile development through school team projects, and I am always learning new languages by myself, so I am also practicing solving algorithms. Since I usually watch and learn a lot of coding, it is customary to analyze and debug code while practicing making them my own.

                    Also, I'm familiar with back-end languages like Java or C#, so I know cloud systems' flow of understanding and security. Recently, I've been experiencing everything I need to develop through my projects, and I'm focusing on learning Mongo DB, Express.js, and Node.js.
